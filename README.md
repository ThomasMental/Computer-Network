## Programs

Using Python3. 

sender.sh, receiver.sh, and network_emulator.sh are used to run the python program. 

## Instruction

The bash file should set up the permission if not:
```
chmod u+x receiver.sh
chmod u+x sender.sh
chmod u+x network_emulator.sh
```

1. network_emulator.sh have arguments:
* UDP port number to receive data from sender
* Receiver's network address
* Receiverâ€™s receiving UDP port number
* UDP port number to send data to receiver
* Sender's network address
* Sender's receiving UDP port number
* Maximum Delay
* Drop probability
* Verbose

2. receiver.sh have arguments:
* Host address of the network emulator
* Network emulator's UDP port number
* Network emulator's network address
* Filename to store received data

3. sender.sh have arguments:
* Host address of the network emulator
* UDP port number for the network emulator to receive data
* UDP port for receiving ACKs from the network emulator
* Sender timeout in milliseconds
* Name of file to transfer
